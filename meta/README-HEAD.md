# Compatibility Tracker

This repository contains a table that covers how compatible TextMate grammars provided by [`tm-grammars`](https://github.com/shikijs/textmate-grammars-themes/tree/main/packages/tm-grammars) are with PHP's regular expression engine PCRE2.

Compatibility statistics are updated daily using a GitHub Actions workflow and displayed in a readable table format below.

The goal of this repository is to improve how accurate Phiki's RegEx translation layer is, ensuring grammar files work flawlessly with PHP and Phiki.
